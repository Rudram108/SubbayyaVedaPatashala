His dedication to lord Shiva and his interest in teaching Rudram is outstanding and second to none. We, mentors are still learning and assisting whatever way we can and just trying to help by way of mentoring. Personally, I am following his footsteps and seeking his guidance in spiritual journey.

Your vision of how to know and approach this body of knowledge .What to expect from our self and how to watch the transformation in our self was clearly laid out .The mental outlook and the approach to this learning  was clearly defined .The joy of learning prompted me to share this with more people
